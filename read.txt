She is gone,
So is her presence,
Gone with her is all the happiness,
All the happy moments with her are now just memories,
But it feels good to know that she has departed without worries,
Although the most important person of our family is gone,
And we're left to mourn,
Yet her blessings will stay with us forever and she will leave us never.
